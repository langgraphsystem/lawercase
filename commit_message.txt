feat: Add core tests and fix linting issues

- Adds a comprehensive pytest-based test suite for critical components:
  - Unit tests for LLM Router (fallback, retry, budget)
  - Unit tests for RAG Retriever (dimensions, batching)
  - Integration tests for API security (CORS, JWT, RBAC)
- Introduces placeholder implementations for the router and retriever to support the new tests.
- Adds a `pytest.ini` file and `__init__.py` files to configure the test environment.
- Runs `ruff --fix` to resolve all linting errors across the codebase.
- Adds a `.gitignore` file to exclude `__pycache__` and other common temporary files from version control.
